# This is content from an SVX file

## How it works

All this content is written in markdown. Our mdsvex preprocessor takes svx files, converts its markdown content into pure HTML. Any svelte expressions are also transformed. The resulting output will be a svelte file that can be compiled by the svelte compiler as it would anywhere else in your codebase.
